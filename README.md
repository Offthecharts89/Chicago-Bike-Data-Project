### Summary
* Working with dataset with 100 million datapoints.  
* Tasked by the marketing team of Cyclistic to do an exploratory analysis of their user’s bike data. 
* Giving recommendation from my analysis of how Cyclistic can convert their casual users to full members to increase revenue, as it was previously concluded by Cyclist’s finance team that member riders are the bulk of their revenue and that they should increase the number of member riders.
* My analysis was that casual riders value fun, warm weather and the weekends. Casual riders go on longer rides on average and median. While members are more consistent. Going to work, they use it as a mode of transportation. 
* I advised the marketing team to create a weekend and summer deal. We can have them as bi-annual members or weekend member. This will create a sales funnel for casual riders to eventually become full members. 
* I gave further recommendations to market the warm weather and having fun, as casual riders value these metrics the most, using social media, their own built in app and on their bikes.

### Aggregated the data and performed calculations to find relationships or trends.

Visualized the data in weeks and months. Found a trend that there would be a surge in rides over the weekend and in the summer months

### Compared casual riders to member riders to understand the difference between them.

Casual Riders are much more seasonal in their behaviour. The weather plays a big factor for them as casual rider dip below the bar in the winter months and even pass the bar in the summer months. While member riders are much more consistent. They stay within the bars for most of the year. I can also confidently say that creating a summer package for casual riders to enjoy will boost the companies revenue by creating bi-annual members that can lead onto to becoming full members in the future. 

## Top Three Recommendations

* Create a weekend and bi-annual members package for casual riders to use. This will affectively make them half members.
* Market their riders for fun and warm weather. Casual riders seem to value these metrics the most.
* Use social media, their own built in app and their bikes to promote the deal.
